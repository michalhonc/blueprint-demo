# Blueprint

What if you could have a tool that would help you setup a frontend project with imports from Figma and your OpenAPI and with few clicks setup the page structure and the props map.

In few mins get your Figma designs and REST APIs into shareable form among the whole team or department. Initial version is focusing on NextJS in both pages and app routers.

Still WIP but stay tuned!
